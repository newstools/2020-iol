CAPE TOWN - The Competition Commission has approved Nimble Fund 1’s intention to acquire Edcon Book Debts, the commission said in a statement yesterday. The Nimble Group provides solutions to the credit industry in the consumer and corporate markets, focussing its operations in the non-performing loan segment of the market. It’s four primary functional areas are contingent debt collections, outsourcing in respect of the receivables function; debt purchasing, and fund management. Edcon Book Debts is owned by Edcon Limited. Edcon Book Debts comprise the following categories of loan books: the Non-Performing Book, Written-Off Book, and the Current Foreign Portfolio. The Commission found that the proposed transaction was unlikely to result in a substantial prevention or lessening of competition in any relevant markets and that the transaction would not raise any public interest concerns.
