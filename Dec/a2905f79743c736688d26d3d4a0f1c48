Johannesburg – The Dr Beyers Naude Municipality in the Eastern Cape has deducted over R2 598 207 482 in pension contributions from its employees and failed to make payments to the pension fund since April. The Graaff-Reinet-based municipality is among the 25 councils that collectively made deductions totalling nearly R3 billion, but did not pay over the pension contributions. The criminal offences by these councils has led to the lapsing of pensions of 1 659 employees in five provinces. This emerged in parliamentary responses from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni when he was responding in writing to questions from DA MP Samantha Graham. Graham enquired about the municipalities that failed to pay over pension fund contributions since April this year and what the breakdown of the value of the contributions for each month was by municipality. She also asked about the number of the employees whose pensions have lapsed as a result of non-payment by the affected municipality and action that would be taken against the culprit municipalities, among other things. In his response, Mboweni said he was unable to currently provide a comprehensive response to the questions. "The National Treasury will engage with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) to start collecting such data as part of the regular statutory returns by municipal retirement funds. "However, such practice of non-payment of pension contributions to the pension fund by employers is a criminal offence in terms of section 13A of the Pensions Fund Act, after the Act was amended in 2013," said Mboweni. His responses showed the defaulting municipalities are four in the Eastern Cape, nine in Free State, one in Limpopo, four in North West and five in the Northern Cape – which collectively defaulted on payments totalling R2 971 258 436.14.
