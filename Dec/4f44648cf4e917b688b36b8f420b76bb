Tonight, IOL heeds the call to light a candle as we say goodbye to 2020 and welcome in a new year: This candle burns: * In memory of all those who lost their lives, * In tribute to those on the frontline of the Covid-19 pandemic, who worked to care and give dignity to our loved ones when we could not be with them, * For the families of those on the frontline, * In memory of all those who lost their lives, * For those who are grieving, * For those who are battling Covid-19, * For those who worked hard and dug deep to feed and help their communities, * For the journalists and photographers for bringing us news from the frontlines and beyond and for being the publicâ€™s watchdog, * For the schoolchildren who adapted to the new normal and taught us how to stick to the safety protocols and get on with it. * For those who wore masks, sanitised and adhered to social distancing. Keep it up. * For parents who had to carry a double load of handling homeschooling while meeting deadlines, * For grannies and grandads, uncles and aunts who had to double down on the babysitting duties while parents went out to work, * For the scientists grappling with how to treat this new pandemic and working to cure it, * For the artists who kept us entertained while we stayed home and stayed safe, * For those in our bubbles who kept us sane, and sometimes drove us insane, * For those who poured their hearts out on social media, thank you for sharing. * For the IT that made working from home a viable option. * And again for all those who will be missing from our tables next year. ** This list is incomplete.
