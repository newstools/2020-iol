Cape Town – Eskom has for the second day in a row warned that  while no load shedding was immediately anticipated, there was a ’’high probability’’ should any further capacity be lost. In a statement on Friday, Eskom indicated that the system was severely constrained and urged South Africans to use electricity sparingly in order to avoid the risk of load shedding. “Eskom request the public to reduce the usage of electricity as the power generation system is severely constrained this evening and throughout the weekend. The capacity shortage has been caused by the loss of multiple generation units and high load losses. ’’We currently have 7 452MW on planned maintenance, while another 11 035MW of capacity is out on unplanned maintenance. Since last night, additional generating units have returned to service. “Eskom teams are working around the clock to return as many of these units to service as soon as possible,” Eskom said.  #PowerAlert 1Eskom request the public to reduce the usage of electricity as the system is severely constrained, with a high probability of loadshedding pic.twitter.com/knDFZKxlPc  On Wednesday, Eskom reminded South Africans that there is a high probability of load shedding between now and September next year. Exactly a year ago, the power utility implemented stage 6 load shedding citing capacity issues. Eskom has been deliberately cutting electricity to many communities across the country in an effort to ease pressure on the already constrained grid. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said while maintenance was under way at power stations, the risk of rotational power cuts was high. “There remains a high risk of load shedding during this period going all the way to around September 2021 when we will start seeing big improvements in the system.” IOL
