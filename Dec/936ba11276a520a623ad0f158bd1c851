DA to face off with Cogta minister over new restrictions Meanwhile, the DA has taken issue with Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma for moving forward the closing time for restaurants and bars in the amended Covid-19 regulations. On Saturday, DA MP Dean Mcpherson accused Dlamini Zuma of overruling President Cyril Ramaphosa in the latest amended regulations published on Thursday. "This time, Dlamini Zuma has unilaterally decided to change the closing time for restaurants, bars, gyms, cinemas, theatres and museums from 10pm to 9pm," Mcpherson said. On Monday, Ramaphosa said in his address to the nation the hours of the curfew would be longer, starting at 11pm and ending at 4am. Ramaphosa said the curfew was meant to prevent gatherings that go on late into the night, while enabling restaurants, bars and taverns to continue to operate and earn an income. Mcpherson said he has written to Dlamini Zuma and Ramaphosa requesting an urgent answer as to why the closing time has been altered in the cavalier manner. "Establishments like restaurants need every hour they possibly can get to make up for the hard and brutal lockdown that they have been subjected to this year," Mcpherson said. The DA is taking the government to court, challenging the decision to close the beaches in the Garden Route district for the entirety of the festive season. IOL
