Testing data To date, 5 565 928 tests have been completed, of which 31 844 were conducted since the last report. Vaccine plans There are four candidate vaccines that have been studied in the South African population which are produced by Astra Zeneca, Novavax, Johnson&Johnson and Pfizer/ BioNTech. Before a vaccine can be rolled out the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) must assess the safety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine, but, none of the vaccine manufacturers have submitted their applications to SAHPRA as yet. To support South Africaâ€™s efforts to secure early access to Covid-19 vaccines and treatments as soon as they become available, the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Covid-19 Vaccines has been developing a strategy for the implementation of a Covid-19 vaccination rollout. This strategy will include a review of available resources, services delivery platforms, and the required investment to ensure a successful administration to the selected priority groups. Collaboration between the private and public health sectors will be key to the successful implementation of the vaccine. IOL
