I didn’t request it. He merely informed me. I could walk away, but I choose to stay, and challenge it ON PRINCIPLE.  Van Damme said she had been on sick leave for three months but added that she was open about it and was due back at work on December 15. "I informed the Chief Whip I'd stay on my committee work while on sick leave. I disclosed my illness even though I didn't need to. So it is being used against me to sideline me," she said.  I’ve been open about being sick. I’ve been on sick leave for 3 months, ending 15 Dec. I informed the Chief Whip, I’d still focus on my committee work while on sick leave. I disclosed my illness even though I didn’t need to. So it is being used against me to sideline me. K.  Van Damme asked if she had negated her duties while on leave. "Did I drop the ball while I was sick"No. Even when I was sick, like I do when I am well, did I still outperform many of my colleagues? Yes. I asked for no sabbatical. I determine my health. My Drs determine my health. Not my employer," Van Damme tweeted.  Did I drop the ball while I was sick?
