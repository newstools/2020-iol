Durban - Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Wednesday morning ahead of Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his wife, Mary's court appearance. The couple along with at least three other people are accused of fraud and money laundering to the tune of R106 million. While the Bushiri's waited their turn, loyalists gathered outside, armed with placards and holy water, which they used to spray onto members of the Hawks' vehicles parked outside the court. In a video, shared on Twitter which has been seen more than 1 000 times, people are seen standing around a Hawks vehicle, screaming, "fire, fire!"

They are expected to spend a second night in the Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre before they are due back in the dock on Friday.   The Bushiris were arrested on Tuesday. The National Prosecuting Authority said it was alleged the Bushiris and another couple, Willah Joseph Mudolo and Zethu Mudolo, defrauded investors to the amount of just over R106m through an investment scheme. The Mudolos  appeared at the same court on Monday on the same charges.   IOL
