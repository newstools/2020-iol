INTERNATIONAL - Nigerian inflation accelerated for a 13th straight month in September on surging food prices driven by border closures and dollar restrictions as well as lower interest rates. Consumer prices rose 13.7% from a year earlier, compared with 13.2% in August, Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics said in a report published on its website on Thursday. The median estimate of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 13.3%. Costs rose 1.5% in the month. Key Insights What Bloomberg’s Economist Says “This is the fifth year inflation has exceeded the central bank target range of 6% to 9%. This trend is likely to continue as border closures, initially ordered in August to curb smuggling of rice and other products, remain in place,” said Boingotlo Gasealahwe, Africa economist. BLOOMBERG
