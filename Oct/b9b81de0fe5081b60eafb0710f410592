JOHANNESBURG - Privately-owned regional airline, Airlink on Wednesday announced that it has launched a new scheduled passenger air service between Maputo and Johannesburg. The Airlink return flight on the route follows the lifting of travel restrictions that curtailed travel between the neighbouring countries while they both worked to contain the spread of the coronavirus. "Airlink is proud and excited to be launching this brand new service and adding it to our growing Southern Africa route network. It provides travellers with more choices, while also enabling crucial trade, business, tourism and family ties between two close regional markets," said Airlink chief executive officer, Rodger Foster. "Although we have begun flights to Maputo, we plan to add more Mozambican destinations to our schedule in the coming days." He said the airline was providing travellers “seamless connectivity”, with new services linking Johannesburg with Cape Town and also Durban. Connections were also available to Airlink’s other South African destinations, such as Port Elizabeth, East London, Bloemfontein, Upington, Kimberley, Polokwane, Hoedspruit, Nelspruit, Skukuza, Pietermaritzburg, Mthatha and to key destinations throughout the SADC region. “Airlink’s great value for money Economy Class fares include a 20kg free economy class checked in luggage allowance plus a 15kg sporting equipment allowance,” said the company. It said its aircraft have been equipped with High Efficiency Particulate Air Filters (HEPA), which are effective at blocking 99.97% of particulates, including Coronavirus molecules. The HEPA filters sterilise the cabin air, which is renewed entirely every three minutes. African News Agency
