Durban - A robber stole the mask off his victim to hide his identity during a hold-up in Inanda. Prem Balram of Reaction Unit SA said the victim was travelling near Etafuleni, Inanda, on Thursday when he stopped his Ford Ranger bakkie as he approached a speed bump, and heard someone call his name. Two men then held him up at gunpoint. One of the men took the victim’s mask and put it on. The man was told to drive on, and the two men stole his cellphone and cash. Workers cutting grass in the area dropped their equipment and fled when they saw the robbery. “The gunmen then stole two abandoned grass cutting machines and fled on foot,” Balram said. The victim drove to a nearby construction site where he borrowed a phone, called his family, and then went to work. The man was not injured. The Independent on Saturday
