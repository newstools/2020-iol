Equity markets are climbing Thursday as signs of potential progress toward fresh U.S. fiscal stimulus boost appetite for riskier assets. The MSCI Emerging Market Index is 0.4% higher. The South African benchmark dropped 0.2% in the third quarter, lagging behind an 8.7% gain in emerging-market peers. It fell 2.2% in September, sliding for a second month. BLOOMBERG
