Compiled by Dhivana Rajgopaul JOHANNESBURG - The rand was at the mercy of shifts in global risk sentiment as the Trump administration brought an abrupt end to stimulus talks with the Democrats according to NKC Research. However, a tweet from the US President, in support of more stimulus measures, sparked a reversal in risk-on sentiment. Nonetheless, Trump’s decision to call off stimulus talks until after the elections could represent a watershed moment for the US economy as fiscal stimulus is expiring and employment growth is slowing. Without faster job growth – unlikely at this stage of the recovery – or increased fiscal aid, households, businesses and state and local governments will be increasingly susceptible to a deterioration of the health situation. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.14 percent weaker at R16.65/$, after trading in range of R16.54/$ - R16.74/$. The rand traded flat overnight. Expected range today R16.55/$ - R16.70/$.
