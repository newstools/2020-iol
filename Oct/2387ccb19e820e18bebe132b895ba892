Sao Paulo - A Brazilian senator caught in a police raid hiding cash between his buttocks last week has requested a 90-day leave from the Senate, his spokesperson said on Tuesday. The senator, Chico Rodrigues, is the target of an investigation into the misuse of Covid-19 response funding in the northern state of Roraima. He denies any wrongdoing. The senator had already been suspended from the Senate for 90 days by Supreme Court Justice Lu√≠s Roberto Barroso, who added the Senate could decide whether to make the move permanent. Rodrigues was a deputy leader for the agenda of the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, but he stepped down after he was caught with money in his underwear.
