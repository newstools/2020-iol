JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s main stock index halted a three-day rally, falling 0.2% as of 9:48 a.m. in Johannesburg, as weakness in index giants Richemont, Naspers Ltd., BHP Group Plc and Anglo American Plc overpowered the risk-on gains seen in many Asian markets earlier. Sentiment toward riskier assets globally was buoyed after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday she’s hopeful for a stimulus agreement this week on a program that would be bigger, better and retroactive. “Some renewed optimism made its way to markets, as U.S. lawmakers continued to negotiate the relief package, with emerging markets gaining on the hopes in the overnight session,” said Bianca Botes, Executive Director at Peregrine Treasury Solutions.
