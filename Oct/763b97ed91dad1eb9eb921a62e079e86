Cape Town – Eskom issued a warning early on Thursday evening that its power system is under severe pressure. However, there was no mention of load shedding or the likelihood of power cuts. "Please switch off all unnecessary lights, your geyser, pool pump and non-essential appliances," the power utility said in a statement. #PowerAlert 08 October 202018:00Our power system is under severe pressure.

Energy expert Ted Blom believes South Africa could be stuck with load shedding until at least 2025. Earlier on Thursday, Eskom chief executive Andre de Ruyter told the Joburg Indaba, an annual mining event, the positive impact of Eskom's maintenance programme would be felt by April. He expected that there would be a reduced risk of load shedding by September 2021. IOL
