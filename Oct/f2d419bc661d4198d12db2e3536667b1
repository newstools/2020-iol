Johannesburg – A man in his thirties was killed on a farm in Elandsfontein, near Alberton, and a woman died in Melville, Johannesburg, after both had been struck by lightning on Monday afternoon. Flash floods on the M1 North and South also led to peak-hour traffic being disrupted after Gauteng was hit by afternoon thunderstorms. Commenting on the man who had died in Elandsfontein, ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said: “ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene at 16h55 to find the man lying motionless in the field, surrounded by colleagues. ⛈Flooding over parts of Johannesburg this afternoon (05 October 2020).

She was declared dead at the scene. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD)  had urged drivers to exercise extra caution on the roads as flash flooding hit parts of the city. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said officers had been dispatched to several areas to try to maintain order as heavy traffic compounded weather-related issues. The SA Weather Service (SAWS) issued a warning for severe thunderstorms in Gauteng until late on Monday and also warned of possible flooding, especially in low-lying areas, hail and reduced visibility on the roads. An SAWS report further warned that excessive lightning may result in power surges and instructed residents to try to seek shelter indoors away from metal structures during the storm. There were also reports of trees blown over in Florida and Roodepoort. IOL
