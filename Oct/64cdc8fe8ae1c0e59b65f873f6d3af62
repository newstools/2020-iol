He was a former Head of the School of Governance at the University of the Witwatersrand, a former executive director at the Human Sciences Research Council and a Visiting Professor at the University of Free State School of Business. He served the Republic of South Africa in numerous positions in government," Sachs said. I know few people who believed more fervently in our countryâ€™s possibilities than the development activist, Daniel Plaatjies. My heart is broken that you have left us, moved on to higher duty  I am so sad to hear of the passing of Prof Daniel Plaatjies. Iâ€™ve worked with him for years, considered him a friend. He was a regular attendee at parliamentary meetings, and we often met up at his favourite coffee shop to discuss the latest political happenings together.  He was insightful with a cheerful argumentative style and loved a good debate. Prof Plaatjiesâ€™ family can be very proud of his long and distinguished contribution to the South African public service. My sincere condolences to his family.  Highly intelligent, calm, insightful, such a gentleman. Our thoughts are with Lydia and children Danelle, Lidian & LeandrÃ©ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­  Professor Plaatjies is survived by his wife, Lydia, and children Danelle, Lidian and LeandrÃ©. IOL
