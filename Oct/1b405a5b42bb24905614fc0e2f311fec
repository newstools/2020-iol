JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s main stock index fell as much as 1.2% after U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement that he tested positive for Covid-19 roiled markets and drove global equities lower. “A wave of risk-off sentiment swept through global financial markets” after Trump’s news, Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, wrote in an emailed note. Heavyweights BHP Group Plc, Richemont, Anglo American Plc and Naspers Ltd. led the local index lower. Friday’s decline trimmed the gauge’s weekly gain to 1%, its first weekly advance in three.
