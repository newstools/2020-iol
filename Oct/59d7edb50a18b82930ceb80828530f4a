The identities of the deceased cannot be disclosed at this stage until their next of kin have been informed,” said Gauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters. Paramedics declared one man dead when they arrived on the scene on Saturday while another man and a woman survived and declined transportation to hospital. “The man explained that the boat was taking on water when it capsized," said ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell.
