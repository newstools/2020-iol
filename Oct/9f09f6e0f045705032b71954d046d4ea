Washington - As the International Space Station (ISS) turned 20, NASA has put together some Halloween celebrations onboard the orbiting laboratory in the past as the world plans the costumes of the future. Although no trick-or-treaters come knocking at the ISS front hatch, crew members aboard the orbiting facility still like to get in the Halloween spirit. "Whether individually or as an entire crew, they will dress up in sometimes spooky, sometimes scary, but always creative costumes, often designed from materials available aboard the ISS," NASA said in a statement on Friday.  Happy Halloween! ðŸŽƒ NASA's SpaceX Crew-1 mission specialist @Astro_Soichi got into the spirit this month with this mission-inspired masterpiece!Did you make a NASA-themed pumpkin carving this year?

There were days when Italian Space Agency astronaut Luca S. Parmitano got his wish to fly like Superman during Expedition 37 and none other than NASA astronaut Scott J. Kelly celebrated Halloween in 2015 with a scary mask during his one-year mission.  20 years ago today . . . Our astronaut Bill Shepherd and Russian crewmates launched to the @Space_Station.
