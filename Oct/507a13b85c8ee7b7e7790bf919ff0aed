Cape Town - Former Ratlou acting municipal manager Cassius Sebatane Sejake was arrested and charged on Monday regarding tender corruption on contracts worth a total of R5.8 million. The Hawks said it was alleged the North West municipality awarded tenders without a proper bidding process. The transgressions allegedly happened between 2018 and 2019. "It is alleged that as the accounting officer, the suspect failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that public procurement processes were followed and observed." Sejake, 45, appeared in the Atamelang magistrate's court and was charged with the contravention of Section 173 of the Municipal Finance Management Act. The matter was postponed until Tuesday when he was expected to apply for bail. The arrest is one of a raft in recent weeks targeting corrupt government officials after the ruling ANC at the end of August vowed to take a tougher stand on graft. Ratlou has been listed as one of the worst run municipalities in the country. This is a developing story. ANA
