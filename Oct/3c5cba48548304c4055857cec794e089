Durban - Backers of the #FeesMustFall movement believe the R10.5 billion allocated to SAA is a slap in the face to those in the fight for free education. More especially after it was revealed that most of the monies will come from other sectors which have previously suffered massive budget cuts in the past. According to reports, the funds will take a big bite out of SAPS and university budgets as well as impact the budgets of the Department of Health and Transport. On Wednesday, during his medium-term budget Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, announced that funds would be allocated to the flailing airline. Following criticism from various quarters, National Treasury said the funds were not a 'bail out'. "The R10.5bn allocated to SAA is not a bail out. A bail out would have made a huge injection into SAA. ’’What's in our budget now are allocations for the requirements of business rescue practitioners," The National Treasury said.
