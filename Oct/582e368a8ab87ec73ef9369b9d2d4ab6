DURBAN - With the lockdown leading to business being run almost exclusively on email, fraudsters are increasingly using email-based scams to catch unsuspecting businesses off-guard. “One of the most common email scams that businesses fall victim to is Business Email Compromise (BEC). Business Email Compromise is a global phenomenon and a form of cybercrime which uses email fraud / email phishing to target businesses, individuals and governments. At its core, the scam leverages digital technology combined with social engineering techniques,” said Nadiah Maharaj, Chief Risk Officer at FNB Business. The scam can be carried out in multiple ways: Business can take the following steps to ensure that they don’t fall victim to this type of fraud: Businesses who have fallen victim to this type of fraud, should contact their Bank immediately to be assisted to stop any payments if possible, as a matter of urgency. The fraud should be reported to the South African Police Services (SAPS). Banks will provide the SAPS with the relevant information, upon receipt of a duly served subpoena. If the fraudster has benefited from the fraud, business can further consider civil recovery and also check with their insurer if it is an insurable loss. “This National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we urge all business owners to educate themselves about cybercrime and commit to staying alert and vigilant” concluded Maharaj.
