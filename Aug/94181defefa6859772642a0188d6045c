Johannesburg - Battered by allegations of corruption and deepening factionalism, the ANC will meet over the weekend for three days and some analysts expect a “showdown” that will do little to salvage the image of the party. The much-anticipated meeting starts on Friday in Pretoria and among the issues expected on the agenda is corruption and how to deal with party members facing corruption and criminal charges. These contentious topics could leave the national executive committee divided as they are expected to discuss the matter of former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede, who was last week moved to the provincial legislature - a move that sparked an outcry. Speaking to SABC News early this week about the deployment, the party’s deputy secretary-general, Jessie Duarte, said the KZN ANC provincial executive committee has been called to the meeting to explain the deployment. Further, Duarte told the public broadcaster that the issue of VBS Mutual Bank would likely be discussed as it has dominated all their previous meetings. She said the matter was even more pressing after Limpopo ANC treasurer Danny Msiza, who was accused of having a hand in the collapse of the bank, was able to get the North Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, to expunge his name from the damning report. Also on the cards are the corruption allegations against party members and relatives accused of milking the state coffers dry in Covid-19 procurement. Political Bureau
