Compiled by Dhivana Rajgopaul JOHANNESBURG - The rand rallied on Friday thanks to carry appeal and risk-on sentiment as the dollar index extended losses amid Jackson Hole policy guidance according to NKC Research. The Fed unveiled significant changes to its policy goals following its 18-month-long comprehensive framework review. As anticipated, the Fed formally adopted flexible average inflation targeting, although, somewhat unexpectedly, it tweaked its employment mandate to be more asymmetric: one in which low unemployment presents less of a need to tighten policy so long as inflation remains close to the 2 percent target. This also signals that the Fed will be willing to let the economy “run hot” in order to promote broad and inclusive employment gains. We continue to forecast that the Fed will keep rates at the effective lower bound until mid-2024. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 1.88 percent stronger at R16.63/$, after trading in range of R16.60/$ - R17.06/$. Expected range today R16.40/$ - R16.80/$.
