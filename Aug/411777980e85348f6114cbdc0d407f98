Compiled by Dhivana Rajgopaul JOHANNESBURG - It was an inside day for the rand as a lack of data releases on the domestic front failed to provide any direction according to NKC Research. That said, the South African currency managed to eke out a slight gain against the USD as investors worried that a United States economic recovery might lag other countries due to the high infection rate. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.35 percent stronger at R17.29/$, after trading in range of R17.17/$ - R17.43/$. The rand traded little changed overnight, and today’s session will likely be a quiet one as market participants sit on their hands in anticipation of tomorrow’s US jobs report. Expected range today R17.15/$ - R17.40/$. South African bourse The JSE All Share (+2.45 percent) ended higher yesterday, led by gains in large gold mining stocks (+6.03 percent).
