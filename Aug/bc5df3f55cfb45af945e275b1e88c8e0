Compiled by Dhivana Rajgopaul The South African currency failed to follow through on a strong start to the week, retreating somewhat to pause a two-day rally according to NKC Research.

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.48 percent weaker at R16.90/$, after trading in range of R16.76/$ - R16.92/$. The rand managed to recoup some of yesterday’s losses overnight. July PPI inflation data is due for release today, but most of the direction is likely to come from the US dollar. Expected range today R16.75/$ - R17.00/$.
