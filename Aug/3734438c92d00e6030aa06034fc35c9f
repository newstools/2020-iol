By Shifaan Ryklief Cape Town - Senator Kamala Harris’s selection for potential vice-president was well received on social media after Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden picked her as his partner in their quest for the presidency. In 2016, Harris became the second black female US senator in history and now the first black woman on a major-party US presidential ticket. “I was raised to take action. My mother knew that she was raising two black daughters who will be treated differently because of how they looked,” said Harris. “Growing up, whenever I got upset about something, my mother would look me in the eye and ask, what are you going to do about it? “That’s why, when I saw a broken justice system, I became a lawyer. To try and fix it,” she said. Analysts have described Biden's choice as safe amid social unrest which has been plaguing the country for months. "If Kamala Harris and I are elected, we're going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided and a world in disarray," Biden tweeted. If @KamalaHarris and I are elected, we’re going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won’t have a minute to waste. That's exactly why I picked her: She's ready to lead on day one. "We won't have a minute to waste and that's exactly why I picked her, she's ready to lead on day one. "As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, Kamala Harris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it first-hand.
