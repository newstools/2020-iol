JOHANNESBURG - The South African currency bounced back from a steep sell-off yesterday following the strikes on US-led forces in Iraq according to NKC Research. However, the tone of the statement by Iran thereafter was somewhat muted, noting that it does not want an escalation, while the US presidency has also been uncharacteristically calm. This has led to the prospect of no further escalation.
