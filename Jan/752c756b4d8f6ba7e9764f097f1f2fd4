DURBAN - TikTok and the World Economic Forum have launched the #AllTheDifference challenge to promote inclusion and diversity as leaders of state and business meet in Davos in January 2020 to discuss inclusive societies. From January 21 to January 27, TikTok users in 75+ global markets, including South Africa, are encouraged to celebrate inclusion and diversity by joining the #AllTheDifference challenge. A special "I say" sticker will be available to help TikTok users express themselves bravely and creatively.
