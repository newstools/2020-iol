ZAGREB — A fire engulfed part of a nursing home in northern Croatia early Saturday, killing at least six people, authorities said. The blaze erupted around 5am in a privately-run nursing home in the village of Andrasevac, 30 kilometers north of Zagreb, the capital. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the fire. “Unfortunately, according to initial information we have received, six people died. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic told reporters after arriving on the scene. “At this moment, we don't have enough information to be able to say anything else." “We need to wait until the authorities finish their job," Plenkovic added. Croatian media said the fire erupted in a wooden building close to the main building of the nursing home. N1 TV said about 20 people were staying there when the fire broke out. Police said the fire was put out quickly, but they could not immediately enter the charred building to conduct the probe. AP
