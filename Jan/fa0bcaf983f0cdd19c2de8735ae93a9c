South Africa has about 14,000 road deaths per year. Volvo’s heavy-duty truck driving school, Iron Women, is actively working towards changing these figures. The Iron Women programme is aimed at training women to become heavy-duty truck drivers. This is because, statistically, women are responsible drivers.
