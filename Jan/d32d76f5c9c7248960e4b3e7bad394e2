 This guy spat in my face. Strangled me. Told me he would slit my throat and get away with it. Said his friend in the police force runs the province. A Mr Langa, who Im sure knows nothing of his abusive ways. I was intended to marry him. I donâ€™t play that game. In a world where we have sleepless nights for our daughters. A man threatening me in this way will have all my wrath. His name is Leshoto Itsweng A post shared by  simphiwe dana ðŸ’œðŸ‘‘ðŸ’œ (@simphiwedana) on Dec 27, 2019 at 12:42pm PST    Related Tags
