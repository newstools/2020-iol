Pretoria - Malawi has dropped from position 120 to 123 out of 180 countries in the 2019 Corruption Perception Index (CPI) released by Transparency International this week. According to online publication Malawi24, the African Institute of Corporate Citizenship (AICC), which is affiliated to the Transparency International Global Coalition, said the southern African country remained “stuck” as there was no progress in the fight against corruption. The remarks were made at an AICC press briefing held in Lilongwe on Thursday. In the 2019 Corruption Perception Index (CPI), Malawi got a score of 31 out of 100, compared to 32 in 2018. Transparency International said the latest CPI revealed that a majority of countries across the world were showing little to no improvement in tackling corruption. “Our analysis also shows corruption is more pervasive in countries where big money can flow freely into electoral campaigns and where governments listen only to the voices of wealthy or well-connected individuals." The index ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, according to experts and business people. It uses a scale of zero to 100, where zero is highly corrupt and 100 is clean. According to Transparency International, more than two-thirds of countries rated scored below 50 on the 2019 CPI, with an average score of just 43. African News Agency (ANA)
