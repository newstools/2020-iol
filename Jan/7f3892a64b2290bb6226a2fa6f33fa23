RUSTENBURG - A couple accused of assaulting a police officer was granted bail at the Ventersdorp Magistrate's Court on Thursday, North West police said. Spokesperson, brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said Norma Bauer Master, 27, and her husband Johan, 41, were granted R300 bail each. They are  facing charges of theft, assault and crimen injuria. The two were arrested on New Year's eve at a filling station in Ventersdorp where they allegedly caused disorder, including refusing to queue to use an automated teller machine (ATM). "It is alleged that the accused assaulted and grabbed the state motor vehicle key from one of the police officers who were called to intervene. Furthermore, the accused reportedly insulted the police officer and in the process used the “K” word.  The pair were subsequently arrested with assistance of street patrollers. During the arrest, the state motor vehicle key was found in possession of Norma," said Mokgwabone. The newly appointed North West provincial commissioner, lieutenant general Sello Kwena, condemned the incident, saying that the conduct displayed by the accused was tantamount to undermining the authority of the state, which could not be tolerated. He applauded street patrollers for their cooperation, which led to the arrests.
