San Francisco â€” David Drummond, the legal chief of Google parent company Alphabet, is leaving at the end of the month, following accusations of inappropriate relationships with employees. Alphabet did not give a reason for Drummond's departure in a short regulatory filing Friday. The company said last November that it was investigating sexual misconduct cases against executives. Claims against Drummond were included in the investigations. Last August, a former Google employee, Jennifer Blakely, published a report of her relationship with Drummond. Drummond has acknowledged a relationship with Blakely, but in a carefully worded statement appeared to deny involvement with other Google employees. Representatives for Alphabet did not immediately respond to emails for further comment on Friday. AP
