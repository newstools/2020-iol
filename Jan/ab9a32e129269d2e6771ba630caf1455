Johannesburg - Three teachers were killed near Kenyaâ€™s border with Somalia in a suspected attack by al-Shabaab militants early on Monday, Reuters reported. Citing a police report, the news agency said a child was also wounded by a stray bullet when the militants attacked Kamuthe primary school in Garissa County. They also burned down a nearby police station and destroyed a telecommunications mast. Al-Shabaab has targeted Kenya in frequent attacks as retaliation for the country sending troops into Somalia to clamp on cross-border raids and kidnappings. Last week, four schoolchildren were killed following a gunfight between militants group and local police in Garissa. The United States has increased its presence in Kenya after al-Shabaab killed three Americans in an attack on a military base. African News Agency/ANA
