Johannesburg - Cash-strapped state carrier South African Airways (SAA) will receive R3.5 billion of emergency funding from the government-owned Development Bank of Southern Africa, the airline's business rescue practitioners said on Tuesday. SAA is fighting for its survival after it entered a form of bankruptcy protection in December and cancelled some flights because of cash shortages. "We can confirm that the Development Bank of Southern Africa has committed R3.5 billion in funding to the SAA Practitioners, with an immediate draw-down of R2 billion," the team overseeing SAA's bankruptcy-protected restructuring said. "Funding for the restructuring phase after the business plan is adopted is being considered by potential funders," the practitioners said. SAA has not made a profit since 2011, surviving instead on more than R20 billion in bailouts over the last three years. That has put the country's credit rating and investor confidence under increasing pressure. The new year saw SAA anxiously awaiting R2 billion of emergency cash promised to it by government when the airline entered bankruptcy protection. But Finance Minister Tito Mboweni stalled, insisting the bailout be done in a way that avoids increasing the country's budget deficit. The wrangling has hurt President Cyril Ramaphosa's mission to revive flagging economic growth and restore foreign investment. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. South African Airways says flights 'normal' as funding woes continue South Africa's struggling state-owned airlines said on Monday that flights to all destinations are operating as normal, as government discussions continue to try and rescue the carrier. The DBSA said it would release a statement outlining details of the funding. SAA did not respond to phone calls and text messages from Reuters requesting comment.
