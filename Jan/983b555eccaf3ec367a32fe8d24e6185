Whoever is the perpetrator of this despicable crime against this man of the cloth must just come forward and confess as the police will leave no stone unturned in their manhunt. "In the same breath, the community is urged to come forward with information that will assist to expedite the police investigations and the arrest of the heartless murderer," said MEC Sello Lehari.
