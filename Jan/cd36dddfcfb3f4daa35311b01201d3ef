Learners in South Africa are being left behind. Over 60% of schools do not have computer centres, equipped libraries, or laboratories. Along with the insufficient facilities, major hindrances to learning include everything from unaffordable fees to large classes, a lack of books, too few teachers, and teacher absenteeism. Poor circumstances inside the classroom can take the joy out of learning, or crush a child’s belief in themselves. In a country desperate to break out of the cycle of poverty and advance, we cannot allow that to happen. The future depends on those who pursue and embrace education.The state of educationAccording to the World Bank, a child in South Africa will complete an average of 9.3 years in school by the age of 18. But in terms of the quality of education, they will only complete 5.1 years. This means at least four years of the time they spend in school is wasted. For Grade 9 Mathematics and Science, South Africa continues to be one of the lower scoring countries, while 78% of learners cannot read for comprehension by the end of Grade 4.This disastrous combination of factors is stifling children’s growth. Education isn’t only about resources or results. It’s about a passion for knowledge, understanding the world, and developing self-confidence. Access to education is life-affirming. But the formal classroom has its limits. While we may not be able to change what happens in schools, we can still foster a love of learning.  Beautiful News South Africa
