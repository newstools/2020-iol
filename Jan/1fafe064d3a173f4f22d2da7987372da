Baghdad - A volley of rockets hit an Iraqi airbase north of the capital Baghdad on Sunday, injuring four Iraqi air force personnel, the army said. Eight rockets struck the Balad airbase, which is hosting US personnel, the military media centre added in a brief statement, according to Iraq's official news agency INA. A local security official had earlier said three Iraqi soldiers were injured after nine mortar shells had landed in the base, some 80 kilometres north of Baghdad. Some shells hit the runway of the facility while another shell struck the gate, Colonel Mohammed Khalil, a police officer in the northern Iraqi province of Salah al-Din, added. So far, there has been no claim of responsibility for the attackÂ that comes amid tensions between the United States and Iran. Earlier this week, Iran launched missile attacks on two Iraqi airbases hosting US troops in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian commander in a US drone strike in Baghdad.
