Johannesburg - The Kenya Association of Travel Agents (KATA) on Friday urged travellers to put off non-essential travel to parts of China in the face of the coronavirus which has killed more than 200 people. The World Health Organisation on Thursday night declared the virus - first detected in Wuhan, China in December - a global health emergency. In a statement, KATA chief executive officer Agnes Mucuha called on those unable to avoid travelling to affected areas to exercise extreme caution when in China. “The outbreak of this contagious disease that has led to loss of life is quite unfortunate," Mucuha said. "We should however not panic but instead take precautionary measures to avoid contracting the virus." “KATA travel agents have the interest of their clients at heart and will advice their travellers on the best course of action to take in order to safeguard from contracting the virus,” she added. KATA has a growing membership of over 200 travel agencies and is itself a member of the Universal Federation of Travel Agents’ Association which represents 84 countries. African News Agency (ANA)
