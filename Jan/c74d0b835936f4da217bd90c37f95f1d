Washington - US President Donald Trump is set to unveil his long-awaited Middle East peace plan on Tuesday - a "deal of the century," according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which has raised concerns of unrest in the Palestinian Territories. Both leaders are set to give a press conference on the plan, which has been three years in the making, in Washington at noon (1700 GMT). "You have been the greatest friend that Israel has had in the White House, and I think tomorrow we can continue making history," said Netanyahu on Monday, after he and his his centre-right political rival Benny Gantz conducted separate meetings with Trump about the plan. According to leaks about the plan published in Israeli media, Trump's plans include the annexation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. However, other reports said the plan foresees some 70 to 80 per cent of the West Bank under Palestinian control. The Israeli army announced on Tuesday that, ahead of the deal's presentation, it would reinforce troops in the Jordan Valley with infantry. Palestinians have already rejected Trump's role as a negotiator in the conflict, saying his series of decidedly pro-Israel moves has disqualified the United StatesÂ from a role in ending the conflict. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for a meeting of leaders in Ramallah at the same time as the plan is to be unveiled. Protest organizers have called on Palestinians to turn out in force for marches and activities rejecting the deal once it is published. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. The Mideast awaits Trump's 'deal of the century' U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his long-awaited peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians within days. Trump's history of upending diplomatic norms in the region means that Palestinian leaders are unlikely to support the "deal of the century.
