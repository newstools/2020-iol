DURBAN - SA Mining company Sibanye-Stillwater said on Tuesday that it had been included in the Bloomberg 2020 Gender-Equality Index (GEI). The group is one of 325 companies globally, and one of only eight South African companies over 11 sectors, that qualified to be included in index. Sibanye CEO, Neal Froneman said the company's inclusion in the index was "heartening". "We aim to establish a working environment, and instil a culture, that supports and proactively attracts women at all levels, and which accelerates gender equity through employee development and improved communication, promoting awareness and understanding of gender diversity and equity, and removing gender-related barriers to make the working environment more conducive for women. Every effort has been made to ensure that our HR policies are gender-neutral." The reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership and talent pipeline, equal pay and gender pay parity, inclusive culture, sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. Nearly 6,000 companies across 84 countries and regions participated in the most recent process.  - African News Agency (ANA)
