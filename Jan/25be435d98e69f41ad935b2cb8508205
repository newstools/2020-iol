Johannesburg - The body of Enock Mpianzi, the Parktown Boys' High School pupil who went missing during an orientation camp in the North West province, has been found by police. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi confirmed the discovery and said that the boy's family had been briefed.     Earlier on Friday, the school in a statement said it realised that the Grade 8 pupil was missing on Thursday morning. "Police Search and Rescue are on-site and are already at work in the area of the river where a water activity was held after the boyâ€™s arrival. The parents of the missing boy are at the venue." "Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this traumatic time," the school said. Meanwhile, Lesufi tweeted on Thursday night that he would join in the search for the missing boy.     He added that the orientation camp has been cancelled.     The rest of the Grade 8 pupils who were on the camp with Mpianzi have since returned home.
