CAPE TOWN â€“ Indluplace, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed South Africa focused affordable residential rental group, said on Wednesday that 8.8 percent lower distributable income of 34,17 cents a share for the six months to March 31 had been impacted by the fair value adjustments, derivatives and loans to participants of a company share scheme.

Headline and diluted headline earnings a share was down 65.3 percent to 12.22 cents. Dividend per share was down 100 percent to 37,49 cents, but the board deferred the decision to declare a dividend to the end of the financial year due to the uncertain environment through the Covid-19 pandemic.
