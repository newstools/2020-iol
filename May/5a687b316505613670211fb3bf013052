Lambert’s current package consists of an annual salary of CHF2m, post employment benefits of CHF112 947, short-term incentive of CHF1.44m, share-based awards of CHF4.16m and social security cost of CHF332 902. However, his annual salary of CHF2m was up by 7.53 percent compared to last year’s CHF1.86m. Clay Brendish, the chairperson of the compensation committee, said the group had put structures in place for the remuneration of the group's executives and employees which remained under continual review by the committee to ensure that executives are remunerated fairly and in line with the group's strategic objectives. “Incentivising creativity and long-term value creation becomes ever more important in the current difficult economic climate, and the committee remains dedicated to ensuring that these principles are appropriately applied,” Brendish said. The annual report comes after the group reported a 2 percent increase in sales to €14.24 billion (R272.2bn) for the year to end March, impacted by an 18 percent decline in sales for the fourth quarter as a result of the outbreak of Covid-19 in some of its regions.

The group’s chief financial officer (CFO),Burkhart Grund, received a total remuneration package of CHF6.03m, up by 11.87 percent compared to last year’s CHF5.39m. His annual salary remained flat at CHF1.52m, but his total package was boosted by share-based awards of CHF3.51m in the current year compared to the stock option award of CHF1.74m last year.

The group said during the year Bos, Lambert and Emmanuel Perrin also received a cash payout as a result of a long-term incentive award made in 2016 as compensation for their positions as brand executives at that time.
