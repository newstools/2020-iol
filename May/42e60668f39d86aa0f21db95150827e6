This comes as South Africa on Tuesday had 26 new Covid-19 related deaths and 767 new infections. Of those new deaths and infections, 23 of the 26 new deaths were from the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, while out of the 767 new cases, 687 infections came from the two provinces. The Western Cape is the epicenter of the Covid-19 virus in South Africa, with 60% of all cases and deaths stemming from the province after a cluster outbreak. The Northern Cape on Tuesday, regrettably, said Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, recorded its first Covid-19 death.
