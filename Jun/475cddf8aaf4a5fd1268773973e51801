The business rescue team on Wednesday warned they would not have the money to pay the salaries of all staff for the month, and dismissed suggestions from government they had not managed the costs of the operation well. "A leadership compact forum comprising the department of public enterprises and all the unions and non-unionised bodies at SAA proposed that there be pay cuts for the month of May," Les Matuson and Siphiwe Dongwana said. "However, SAA does not have sufficient funds available to pay salaries to all of its employees and, in fact, does not have sufficient funds to pay certain of its post-business rescue costs."
