At the time they said: “The Department has finalised an agreement with Nedbank to support spaza shops and general dealers on the back of the Credit Guarantee Scheme of SEFA.” To ensure that, during lockdown, there is a maximum outreach and ultimately maximum participation by spaza shops owners who do not have Wi-Fi connectivity and internet hardware at homes to apply for the support programme, on May 24, 2020, The Black Business Chamber (BBC) approached Small Enterprise Finance Agency (SEFA) via Don Mashele Head: Development Impact Support for purposes of partnering in rolling out SMME support programmes.
