Washington – President Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to call for the arrest of protesters involved in this week's attempt to pull down the statue of Andrew Jackson from a park directly in front of the White House. Trump on Friday retweeted a FBI wanted poster showing pictures of 15 protesters who are wanted for “vandalization of federal property.” Trump wrote, “MANY people in custody, with many others being sought for Vandalization of Federal Property in Lafayette Park. 10 year prison sentences!” Statistics released by the Metropolitan Police Department show that nine people were arrested on Tuesday night and a total of 12 arrested between Monday and Wednesday. There were no protest-related arrests on Thursday, according to the MPD data. Demonstrators have grown increasingly emboldened about targeting statues deemed offensive or inappropriate. Last week on June 19 or Juneteenth, the day marking the end of slavery in the United States, cheering crowds puled down a statue of former Confederate general The targeting of the statues has become a rallying cry for Trump and other conservatives. Immediately after the Pike statute was toppled and set ablaze, Trump called the incident “A disgrace to our Country!” on Twitter. On Tuesday he tweeted, “I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison, per the Veteran’s Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent.” AP
