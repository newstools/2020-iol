INTERNATIOANL - American Airlines Group said Thursday it will boost its US flight schedule next month over dramatic reductions since the coronavirus pandemic, planning to fly more than 55 percent of its July 2019 domestic capacity. The largest US airline will also boost its international flights schedule next month, flying nearly 20 percent of its July 2019 schedule. By comparison, American flew just 20 percent of its domestic schedule in May and is flying 25 percent in June, said Vasu Raja, American Airlines’ senior vice president of network strategy. “As an airline, we’ve consciously bet on demand coming back. We have bet the economy,” Raja said, noting American has been operating a larger schedule than US rivals. Raja told Reuters that the airline would fly just over 4000 flights on peak days in July compared with nearly 2000 on peak days in May. That is still down from the peak 6800 daily flights before the crisis.
