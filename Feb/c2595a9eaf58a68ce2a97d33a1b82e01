Cape Town - While everyone was waiting for President Cyril Ramaphosa to start his State of the Nation Address (SONA), Twitter was enjoying the delay the best way they knew how - with memes. Chairperson of National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Amos Masondo unexpectedly became a meme during SONA for his facial expressions as the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) kept raising points delaying the president from starting his speech. The NCOP is one of the two Houses of Parliament. The NCOP is constitutionally mandated to ensure that provincial interests are taken into account in the national sphere of government. Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise was handling business and interruptions from the EFF, Masondo would speak up occasionally but it was Modise who was bearing the brunt of the objections. Here were some of the reactions from social media over Masondo's facial expressions:     If "I wish I should have stayed at home, and watched Generations with my wife" was a person 😂😂😂🏡#SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/Z24hSUtFJQ     If CHAIR was a personUseless🤣🤣🤣🤣#SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/MmFoovc7Nf     This man just realized he’s too old for this💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣#SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/FHCgFYiCy8     #SONA2020When you have a PhD in minding your own business pic.twitter.com/zojNFxFxnE     Somebody should really check up on this Madala, he is not coping #SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/ioGpOV1Jqn     If “I should’ve stayed home” was a person 🤣 #SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/N8DHjvOerK     #SONA2020 when you remember that your baes birthday is also on Valentine's Day😂😂💔💔💔💔💔💔 pic.twitter.com/HLu9cLQiuY     Moguy thinking, I'm too old for this #SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/01vkUovfs2     If “Taking it all in” was a person #SONA2020 #SONA pic.twitter.com/4DS93q5YlM     If man with few words was a person 😂#SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/Msv9lWTCfG     The farther //// The son #SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/scpIQu2kQH     I did not sign up for this, sh***t, should be at home playing with my great, great, great, great, great grand kids! #SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/AsHcYCk2pW     This man is not really coping up with this whole situation. #SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/9zmIZOBtQD Cape Argus
