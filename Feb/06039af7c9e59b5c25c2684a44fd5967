Kakamegat, Kenya - Kenyan police said on Monday they have launched investigations into a stampede at a local primary school in western Kenya that resulted in the death of 14 pupils and 38 injuries. David Kabena, Kakamega divisional police commander, said the stampede occurred at Kakamega Primary School at around 5 pm when the pupils were rushing out of classrooms. Kabena told journalists that the stampede happened as the pupils of class 5 were leaving the classroom located on the top floor of a three-storey building. Thirteen died on the spot, most of whom fell down from the stairs, while 39 others were admitted to a hospital, one of whom later died and four were in critical condition. Twenty have been discharged after treatment. "We have launched investigations to establish the cause of the stampede," said the police commander. Sources at the school said a teacher was trying to punish one pupil when the rest struggled to rush out and ran down a staircase and in the process, some fell and were trampled to death. Responders including police and personnel from the Kenya Red Cross Society went to the school to offer emergency services. Xinhua
