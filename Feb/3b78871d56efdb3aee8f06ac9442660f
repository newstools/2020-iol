Rustenburg - Two brothers have appeared in court for allegedly killing their father, Free State police said on Thursday. Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Sam Makhele said Matetela Fani Monareng, 24, and Mohau Ben Monareng, 21, from Bochabela Village in Qwaqwa appeared briefly in the Phuthadijhaba Magistrateâ€™s Court on Wednesday for the murder of their biological father. The case was postponed to February 26 for formal bail application. They were arrested on February 10 after a 24-year-old complainant went to the police station to report a domestic violence incident at his home. "The police went with the complainant to his residence and on arrival they found the body of a man lying on the ground with his throat cut and multiple stab wounds to his upper body. The deceased Nono Paulsi Monareng, 49, who was a general worker at Phuthadijhaba Mounted Unit was declared dead at the scene," he said. During preliminary investigations it was alleged that the deceased's youngest son was fighting with his father, which ultimately led to the stabbing. Both brothers were arrested, detained and charged with murder. "The motive behind the alleged murder of their father is unknown at this stage," said Makhele. African News Agency (ANA)
