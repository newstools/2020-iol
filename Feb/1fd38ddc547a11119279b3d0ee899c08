Young people need a voice. Now is the time to have young people involved in every aspect of government, business and society. We have to give young people a platform to showcase their leadership and talents. We have to change the conversation from talking about the problems, to doing something to remedy the problems. ACTIVATE! Change Drivers was initiated in January 2012, and to date has equipped 4267 young South Africans with the training to change their lives, and improve their communities. To date, the unemployment rate within the ACTVATE! Network is 29%, which is below the national youth unemployment of 52.8%. On the social front, 90% of all Activators are involved in prosocial activities while 44% are involved in HIV/AIDS initiatives. At least 90% of all Activators showed interest to vote in 2019 compared to the national average of 71%, and 70% have signed a petition before, this is more than 15% national average. Members of the ACTIVATE! Network have more chances of being self-efficient and driving positive change in their communities. ACTIVATE! Change Drivers is on a quest to recruit more young people into this unique network in an effort to forge a brighter future for the youth of South Africa. Young people know their potential and what they have to offer South Africa. We need to help them realise their potential. South Africa, as a collective, has not tapped into what young people can do for our country. We need to rectify that as a matter of urgency in 2020. To join the ACTIVATE!
