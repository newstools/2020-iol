JOHANNESBURG -  THE COEGA Development Corporation (CDC) Board announced yesterday that it had appointed Khwezi Tiya as its chief executive effective from January. Former chief executive Pepi Silinga resigned in September to join the Transnet National Ports Authority of the CDC. The CDC board then undertook a recruitment process. CDC said that it had looked to source a suitable candidate to step into the shoes of the chief executive of the organisation and lead it in its quest to remain the most successful special economic zone in the country, as well as to steer it to its next level of success and recognition as a force to be reckoned with not only in South Africa but more so throughout Africa and globally. CDC said: “Tiya, who is no stranger to the CDC, brings with him a wealth of experience, integrity and solid investment focus. He brings with him a collective of all the attributes that the CDC requires from a leader to grow it to unimagined levels. His credible reputation as an acclaimed and empowering leader will undoubtedly benefit the interests of the shareholder.” COEGA’s new Chief Executive holds a BSc Civil Eng (University of Natal, South Africa); an MBA (Nyenrode Business Universiteit, the Netherlands) and an MSc Financial Management (SOAS, University of London, UK) among other accreditations.
