The incident took place on Friday afternoon in Mutale, outside Thohoyandou, in the Vhembe District. According to police, the deceased, a 57-year-old warrant officer, routinely visited the cells and was attacked by the suspect who stabbed him several times. “The suspect took the keys from the deceased and stole money from the safe before escaping,” Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said.
