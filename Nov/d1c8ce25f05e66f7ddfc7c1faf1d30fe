Durban - Twitter has erupted over a video of a group of men chasing two women as a taxi rank, somewhere in South Africa. In the video, the women are seen walking through the rank and men can be seen running after them, at one point, a man lifts up one of the women's outfits, exposing her buttocks. In the background, other women can be heard telling the men to leave the two alone. Yoh! pic.twitter.com/6hSZxCCh4U  While many argued that the women were 'not dressed appropriately', others defended them adding that the men were the problem. "There is nothing wrong with the outfits, the problem is the horny men who can't control their lust. Their behaviour is the very same that would make (them) rape and say "they asked for it". We can't be dictated to by men on what to wear," tweeted @gumbi_mapaseka  There is nothing  wrong with the outfits, the problem is the horny men who can't control their lust.
