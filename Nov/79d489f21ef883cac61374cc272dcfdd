JOHANNESBURG - The rand swung between gains and losses as global markets whipsawed on a tight US electoral race according to NKC Research. Despite swirling uncertainty over the outcome of the US elections, two points are clear: The Blue wave didnâ€™t materialise, and a status quo policy environment looks increasingly likely. The battle for the White House still has not been decided as major swing states are still finalising the count of early and mail-in votes, but the Senate race is likely to be undecided for a while longer. However, tight margins across states increase the prospects of either candidate challenging the electoral outcome and raise the odds that neither candidates fiscal agenda will be implemented. Markets appear to agree with our perspective that the outcome will produce much less definitive policy support. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.64 percent stronger at R15.94/$, after trading in range of R15.93/$ - R16.43/$. Expected range today R15.70/$ - R16.10/$. South African bourse The JSE All Share (0.88 percent) rose yesterday, thanks to gains in large tech stocks (3.54 percent). In the overall EM sphere, the MSCI Emerging Market Index (0.06 percent) inched higher. Brent crude oil The Brent oil price advanced yesterday after recent data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed crude stockpiles dropped 8 million barrels last week to around 487 million barrels. At the close of local trade, benchmark Brent crude futures quoted 1.74 percent higher at $40.44pb. Crude prices traded little changed during Asian trade this morning. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
