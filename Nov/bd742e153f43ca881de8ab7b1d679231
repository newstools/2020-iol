Race to ensure access to vaccine President Xi Jinping has assured world leaders that China, which has five vaccines in Phase III trial, is ready to step up global Covid-19 vaccine cooperation. "China is willing to strengthen cooperation with other countries in the research and development, production, and distribution of vaccines," Xi told the G20 virtual summit which is being hosted by Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile fears are rising that poorer countries will be left behind when the vaccines are ready for roll-out. The World health organization has championed a programme called COVAX which will govern how the vaccine is distributed. However, wealthy countries have already struck deals with top drugmakers for millions of doses. IOL
