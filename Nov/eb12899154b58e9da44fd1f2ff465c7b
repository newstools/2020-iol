There will also be ongoing risk communication to sustain adherence to NPIs. “We have seen increase in activities in Eastern Cape and Western Cape. We can’t say this is a new surge but we are observing these areas,” said Mkhize. He said more testing will be done in the the Eastern Cape, Free State, Northern Cape and Western Cape.
