It’s been an eventful year, and now more than ever people are looking for objective insights and quality information. PSG saw the opportunity to stimulate debate by hosting open and honest conversations, sharing their valuable insights through the Think Big webinar series, which kicked off in July this year. “Feedback has been very positive. We initially had a five-speaker line-up, but we have kept extending it during the year and have just confirmed the series will continue for  some months of next year,” says PSG’s Chief Marketing Officer Tracy Hirst. Eskom and ESG under the spotlight in PSG’s final Think Big sessions for 2020 Respected journalist and series host Bruce Whitfield will be asking some tough questions when he hosts Tuesday’s guest, Group Chief Executive of Eskom Holdings SOC Limited, André de Ruyter. They will discuss where to next for the power utility. A secure energy supply remains key to South Africa´s future economic outcomes but Eskom has many challenges to tackle. André shares his views in what promises to be an enlightening, penultimate webinar discussion for 2020. On 8 December, the final webinar for the year takes place. Tracey Davies, the Executive Director of Just Share will delve deeper into the future of South Africa's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) climate. While prioritising economic growth is essential in South Africa, keeping ESG factors in mind is priority too – it is no longer an “either-or" discussion. Tracey promotes the use of investor power for a fairer South Africa. She will cover ESG issues and the intersection between them, including inequality, climate change, diversity and transformation. This final webinar in the 2020 series is not to be missed. Book your free, virtual seat, or view past sessions online The series is open to all, and free of charge.
