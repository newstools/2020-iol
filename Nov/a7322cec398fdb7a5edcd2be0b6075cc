Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the SABC said it would press ahead with retrenchments at the public broadcaster after the group executive for news and current affairs, said on Tuesday afternoon in a heated meeting with staff, that retrenchment notices had been withdrawn. “In light of the unfortunate incident which took place at our news division last night, please note that the Section189 process is continuing as planned. “SABC management and its board apologise for any confusion that was created yesterday afternoon. Management will engage with the news team on the concerns that they have raised,” the SABC said in an urgent update on Wednesday morning. Deputy board chairperson Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi said the board was divided on retrenchments at the public broadcaster. She said at least five board members – including herself – were against retrenchments at the SABC. “Some on the board do not agree with the Section 189 process. We feel there must be better consultation and we feel that Section 189 takes the SABC backwards instead of forwards. “Some on the board have been pushing this issue of Section 189 very vigorously, but some of us feel that the Section 189 process will have a detrimental effect on the turnaround strategy of the SABC,” she said.
