JOHANNESBURG – South African wireline and wireless telecommunications provider Telkom and public broadcaster SABC have entered a partnership to launch a new streaming channel, the two companies said on Monday. In a joint statement, they said the mobile operator channel, TelkomONE, would house the South African Broadcastng Corporation’s (SABC) free-to-air radio and television  channels. The five-year partnership, a first of its kind digital carriage agreement for the SABC, will showcase South Africa's most-watched TV programmes and most listened to radio platforms on one online platform. “We are excited about the opportunity to provide all South African's with free access to watch their favourite SABC content, online, when and wherever they want,” Telkom's group chief executive officer Sipho Maseko said. “TelkomONE will make it possible for subscribers to pause, go back into the programme guide and instantly watch a scheduled TV show they may have missed. Telkom is making digital TV functionality available to all.” SABC group chief executive Madoda Mxakwe said Telkom was a natural partner with whom the broadcaster could build a new platform for developing and disseminating South African content. “Through the new streaming channel, we will further promote universal access to popular SABC content for audiences and customers, in an affordable manner and with ease of access on mobile,” he said. “We will also create added opportunities for our talented local producers to showcase more of their work on a platform on which content can live longer than on traditional media platforms.” The SABC will provide its content to Telkom on a non-exclusive basis and will in exchange receive a carriage licence fee as well as share in the advertising revenue generated on the TelkomONE platform.
