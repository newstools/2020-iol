JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s main stock index rises 0.3% by 9:36 a.m. in Johannesburg, extending gains for a seventh consecutive day, the longest winning streak since June 2019, as miners advance following positive economic data from China. The benchnmark index is also bolstered by a rally in gold stocks, with bullion prices climbing before the two-day U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting starting Tuesday. Investors are seeking clues on the outlook for immediate policy tweaks to fight the pandemic’s impact as well as the bank’s new stance on rekindling inflation. South Africa joins Asian peers in advancing Tuesday, as a pick up in China’s recovery spurs risk-on sentiment. China registered the first growth in retail sales since Covid-19 hit early in the year and as industrial output beat analyst estimates, underscoring a rebound in economic activity. BLOOMBERG
