JOHANNESBURG - The South African currency retreated in the face of an abysmal – and weaker-than-expected – Q2 GDP release according to NKC Research.

An upsurge in US-Sino trade tensions also soured sentiment towards risk assets. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 1.05 percent weaker at R16.90/$, after trading in range of R16.70/$ - R17.00/$. The rand remained under pressure in Asian trading.
