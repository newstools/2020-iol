By Neil De Beer JOHANNESBURG - Since the “new dawn” of presidency two-and-a-half years ago, many things were to be addressed with soaring levels of poverty, inequality and the huge unemployment crisis. So far not much has been delivered, coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic exploiting all these fragilities even more. To further strengthen economic dynamism in my view, a new master plan should be implemented by the government, business and labour which seeks to achieve a common policy objective to save the country and analyse, access, scrutinise and evaluate the “plan” that is not currently effective for our economy. The new South African master plan should take consideration of: The new master plan demands discipline, courage, conviction, tough choices to resolve the economic crisis. There is simply no way out, we must get the country working again by boosting industry competitiveness and creating jobs. Abandonment of responsibility is simply no longer a choice. South Africa needs leadership that is accountable, responsible and can challenge the means of powerful interests within the deep roots of political nestle.
