DURBAN - Businesses are faced with intermittent load shedding and they need to ensure that they always take the necessary measures to safeguard their assets in the event of power interruptions. Malesela Maupa, Head of Insurer Relationships at FNB Insurance Brokers said that the introduction of various load shedding notification apps can play a role in helping to mitigate some of the risks as business owners can see the load shedding schedules and check when load shedding will affect their areas. He shares key points to consider on how businesses can safeguard their assets and continue to operate during load shedding: Maupa said that during load shedding, some businesses are overly exposed in that their security systems and processes might be compromised. If security cameras are not working, businesses are more vulnerable to crime. Having measures such as power generators or other alternative energy supplies can help reduce the vulnerability of businesses being exposed to crime. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
