Egypt suspended regular commercial flights in March because of the coronavirus outbreak. According to online news publication Egypt Independent, EgyptAir currently operates direct flights to more than 35 international destinations and plans to increase the number of available destinations as more countries reopen for international travel. Meanwhile, on October 1, South Africa will also welcome back tourists from “most” countries, including all travellers from the African continent and from countries outside Africa with a low rate of Covid-19 infection and transmission, reported business news and technology site Business Tech. According to tourism website Travel Off Path, most countries in Africa have been very strict on containing the spread of the coronavirus, with most nations going into a state of hard lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic. The continent's swift response to the outbreak has seen relatively low case numbers, with many nations preparing to reopen their economies and borders. African News Agency
