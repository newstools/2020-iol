According to Dr Michael Ryan, WHO Executive Director of Health Emergencies Programme, SA reached out to the WHO as a means of identifying areas in which effective strategies could be worked upon. He said SA reached out to the WHO, not through weakness but through strength in recognising that it had a complex outbreak on its hands. WHO Director General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, said last month, SA's cases showed a significant reduction since the peak which was experienced in July. “The most important indicator is deaths. South Africa is doing its best and we are very glad to partner and send our colleagues to work in SA. With the current trend, we hope to further push the decline and control the pandemic,” he said. Ghebreyesus went on to thank the SA government and President Cyril Ramaphosa for their efforts. IOL
