Compiled by Dhivana Rajgopaul JOHANNESBURG - A stronger performance by the trade-weighted USD placed pressure on most emerging market currencies during Wednesdayâ€™s session according to NKC Research. The South African currency slumped as the country fell into darkness with loadshedding revised from stage 2 to stage 4. Embattled parastatal Eskom warned that loadshedding will persist throughout the week as the colder weather upped demand for electricity, with the increased pressure on the grid exacerbating a breakdown in multiple generation units. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 1.48 percent weaker at R16.88/$, after trading in range of R16.62/$ - R16.92/$. The rand remained under pressure overnight. Expected range today R16.70/$ - R17.00/$. South African bourse The JSE All Share (-0.12 percent) ended lower yesterday, dragged mainly by losses in large gold mining (-3.04 percent) and banking (-2.80 percent) stocks, after Eskom ramped up loadshedding to level 4. In the overall emerging market sphere, the MSCI Emerging Market Index (-0.10 percent) traded weaker. Brent crude oil The Brent oil price fell suddenly yesterday afternoon, following a sharp rise in the greenback. At the close of local trade, benchmark Brent crude futures quoted 1.18 percent lower at $45.36pb. Crude prices remained downbeat during Asian trade this morning.
