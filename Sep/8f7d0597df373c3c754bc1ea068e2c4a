Johannesburg - Eskom has downgraded loadshedding to Stage 1, effective from 12pm midday, until 10pm on Sunday night. This follows a week of load shedding that wreaked havoc on the economy, with Stage 4 being implemented on Wednesday and Thursday, meaning that some areas were without power twice in one day. Loadshedding was downgraded to Stage 3 on Friday, and then to Stage 2 over the weekend. The move to Stage 1 does, however, mean that the Cape Town will not experience load shedding for the remainder of Sunday, as the city has additional capacity that allows it to operate at one loadshedding level below the rest of the country. Eskom did not provide an update on South Africaâ€™s power generation status on Sunday, but the utility did promise to furnish more details later in the day. Late last week Deputy President David Mabuza assured the country that government would turn the corner and fix Eskom, the Independent Media Political Bureau reported. Part of the plan was to bring Medupi and Kusile power stations online soon. This would ensure more energy generation capacity for the country. Mabuza also said that government would bring in Independent Power Producers to ensure there was energy security. Eskom has been under pressure in recent times and this week it told the standing committee on appropriations that its debt has increased from R440 billion to R448bn. Mabuza said they wanted to make sure that Eskom reduces its debt and strengthen its balance sheet. IOL & Political Bureau
