JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s main stock benchmark declines 0.3% by 9:42 a.m. in Johannesburg, before the release of data that may show the unemployment rate in the country rose to a record in the second quarter. Banks retreated after surging by the most in almost three weeks in Monday’s session. Unemployment is expected to increase to 35%, according to the median estimate in an economist survey, the highest among 83 countries tracked by Bloomberg. BLOOMBERG
