"We have been very concerned to see videos on social media of people hosting large parties and going to shebeens, taverns, and bars beyond the curfew. We urge our people to continue observing health protocols such as social distancing, wearing of masks, sanitising and washing of hands. We also caution against sharing of drinks, cigarettes, cigars, shisha pipes ('hubbly bubbly') etc. Be aware that if you do this you have directly put yourself at risk. "While socialising and having fun, do not let your guard down and put your life and the lives of your loved ones at risk. The threat of a second wave remains very real. As we start the weekend, we wish to plead with South Africans to adhere to the curfew and not to drink excessively and irresponsibly," Mkhize said. "We are encouraged to see some key indicators showing improvement in the state of the South African pandemic. In the world ranking of total number of cases per country, we have dropped from 5th position to 7th position," Mkhize said in a statement. IOL
