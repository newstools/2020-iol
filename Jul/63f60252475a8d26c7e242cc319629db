Washington - The head of the Senate Commerce Committee is demanding Twitter staff brief the Congressional body by July 23 on the nature of this week's hack of prominent accounts, as lawmakers start to enforce oversight. Influential figures like Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos and others saw their accounts briefly hacked, posting a message for a Bitcoin scam. "It cannot be overstated how troubling this incident is, both in its effects and in the apparent failure of Twitter's internal controls to prevent it," said Senator Roger Wicker in a letter to Twitter chief JackÂ Dorsey. Wicker noted that the hack appeared to be for financial gain, but the same methods could be used for more nefarious purposes. "It is not difficult to imagine future attacks being used to spread disinformation or otherwise sow discord through high-profile accounts, particularly through those of world leaders," Wicker said. Notably, President Donald Trump is prone to announce policy over social media. Twitter has said it believes there was a "coordinated social engineering attack". To get control over its platform again, Twitter suspended certain functions for hours. Those have largely been restored.
