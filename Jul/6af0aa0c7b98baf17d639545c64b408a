JOHANNESBURG - The South African currency benefited from a retreating greenback as a lack of local releases turned the attention to the two-day FOMC meeting which will conclude on Wednesday according to NKC Research.

We believe the Fed is leaning towards stating it will not lift interest rates off the effective lower bound (ELB) until inflation is sustainably at or above the 2 percent y-o-y target, which could be until 2024.
