A month ago, Caster Semenya and her wife, Violet Raseboya, hinted that they were pregnant. In June, the double Olympic champion, Semenya posted a cryptic post on her social media accounts leaving the world guessing. In a recent post, Raseboya showed off her beautiful pregnancy bump in an Instagram picture, which seems like the couple are pregnant, however this is a picture from August 2019. It is still unclear whether the couple are having another baby, or are just pranking the world.
