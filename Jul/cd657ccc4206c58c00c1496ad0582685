Johannesburg - The Organised Crime Unit of the SAPS and the Protection Services of the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) have arrested two suspects in possession of stolen assets belonging to the rail agency. The stolen assets are believed to be worth almost R2 million in value. One of the suspects is an employee of Prasa at management level at one signal depot in the Germiston area in the city of Ekurhuleni. The other is a former Prasa manager who now owns and runs an electrical and railway equipment supply company. The arrests come after an intense investigation by the unit of the SAPS and Prasa’s security personnel, which also included a warrant to search premises of the manufacturing company. About 12 points machines and 50 signal tuning units, all belonging to Prasa, were recovered. The two suspects were detained at Elsburg SAPS. They are expected to appear at the local magistrate’s court on Monday. “The two arrests are part of numerous that have taken place since the appointment of acting head of Prasa Protection Services, retired Brigadier General Tebogo Rakau earlier this year,” said PRASA spokesperson Makhosini Mgitywa in a statement on Sunday. “The process to recruit 3 100 security personnel into PRASA’s payroll continues. This follows PRASA Administrator Bongisizwe Mpondo decision to insource the security personnel after several security contracts were terminated by PRASA. The contracts were found by the offices of the Public Protector and the Auditor-General to have been irregular.” Four PRASA employees were dismissed last month over their involvement in the procurement of the irregular contracts. A total of 3 100 new recruits are expected to commence their guard duties in August 2020. The investigation continues and further arrests are possible. IOL
