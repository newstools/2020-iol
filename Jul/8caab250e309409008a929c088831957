 Johannesburg - Deputy President David Mabuza will no longer appear before the National Council of Provinces on Thursday due to "ill health". Mabuza was scheduled to answer questions on Thursday at the NCOP and next week during a sitting of the National Assembly. "The Speaker of the National Assembly Ms Thandi Modise and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Mr Amos Masondo, have received an apology from Deputy President Mr David Mabuza, that he is unable to honour scheduled appearances in both Houses due to ill health. The deputy president was scheduled to answer oral questions in the NCOP on Thursday, 24 July, and in the NA next week, on 30 July. "The deputy president has undertaken to avail himself to appear before both Houses, on a mutually agreed date, upon his full recovery. The presiding officers have wished the deputy president a speedy recovery," Parliament said in a statement on Wednesday. It is unclear what has caused Mabuza's sudden illness. Last month he had appeared in Parliament to answer questions. In an unrelated matter, several Cabinet ministers have contracted the coronavirus with some being admitted to hospital. Gwede Mantashe, the minister of mineral resources, and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi have been admitted to hospital after they tested positive. The ANC in Parliament had also confirmed about 10 MPs had tested positive for the virus including Cedric Frolick. IOL
