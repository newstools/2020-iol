Johannesburg - There are at least 44 466 people currently living with Covid-19 in Gauteng, and the majority of them can be found in the Johannesburg region, which has just under 20 000 active cases. Narrowed down further by suburbia, you are most likely to encounter someone with coronavirus in the Joburg Inner City, Joburg South, Soweto, Alexandra and Sandton suburbs. Regions F, D and E account for at least 11 360 active cases in the province. This as Covid-19 related deaths in the Gauteng province are beginning to climb - with the latest death toll showing 353 deaths in the province. Just under half of those deaths, or 170, are from the Johannesburg region - the smallest most populated municipal area in the province. Earlier on Monday, Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku clarified that the provincial coronavirus command council had not requested that Gauteng return to a stringent level 5 hard lockdown. He however expressed concern at growing infections - particularly among health workers. The provincial health department also said more than 2500 people were currently hospitalized due to Covid-19. At the weekend, a report in the Sunday Independent said some Sowetan residents were blaming the government in the area with the second-most infections in Gauteng. At the Dobsonville Mall, the Sunday Independent reported that the streets were filled with street vendors and crowds of people moving around. Among them was Mfundo Silekwa who admitted that this type of behaviour was a “normal thing” in Dobsonville - even during level 5. “As shocking as those numbers are, I can believe them because the reopening of alcohol messed things up further, and this comes from a drinker. “I don’t see any numbers subsiding on this side of the world, especially if the health department doesn’t control the situation. We are doomed,” he said.
