Cosatu has threatened to go on strike over the decision of the government to increase the capacity of taxis to 100%. The federation movement warned on Friday this decision by the government posed a threat to the health of workers who are ferried by taxis every day. Cosatu said it would not support the decision to increase the taxi load from 70% to 100% as it was still not safe. It said Covid-19 was now reaching its peak and more people could be exposed to the virus. “The Congress of South African Trade Unions is to submit a section 77 application at Nedlac following the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to allow the taxi operators to fill their taxis to full capacity,” said Cosatu in a statement. “The federation is pursuing the section 77 of the Labour Relations Act, which covers a viable protest action to promote or defend socio-economic interests of workers,” it said. “We are invoking this section on this transport matter with the hope of finding a resolution, but we reserve the right to mobilise for a protest action if we are not happy with the outcomes of the negotiations,” said Cosatu. “This deadly appeasement and capitulation by the government is happening at a time when more workers are getting infected by the deadly Covid-19 virus,” it said.
