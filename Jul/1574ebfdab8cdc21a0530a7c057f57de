We have lost our beloved Moonyeenn Lee. Moon had an extraordinary eye for pure emotional truth. She cast my first short, The Storekeeper, Tsotsi and Eye in the Sky. How can I thank you enough Moon? I will miss you so very much. Rest well my precious courageous friend. #moonyeenn https://t.co/XJ9CsphRFN   Moonyeenn Lee played a significant role in South Africa's performing arts. She was deeply critical of performer training in SA, & more specifically Wits. She challenged, guided, & ultimately supported with Gina, @JohnKani2, Gys and others directing.
